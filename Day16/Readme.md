## --- Day 16: Ticket Translation ---

As you're walking to yet another connecting flight, you realize that one of the legs of your re-routed trip coming up is on a high-speed train. However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.

Unfortunately, you  can't actually  _read_  the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out  _the fields these tickets must have_  and  _the valid ranges_  for values in those fields.

You collect the  _rules for ticket fields_, the  _numbers on your ticket_, and the  _numbers on other nearby tickets_  for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).

The  _rules for ticket fields_  specify a list of fields that exist  _somewhere_  on the ticket and the  _valid ranges of values_  for each field. For example, a rule like  `class: 1-3 or 5-7`  means that one of the fields in every ticket is named  `class`  and can be any value in the ranges  `1-3`  or  `5-7`  (inclusive, such that  `3`  and  `5`  are both valid in this field, but  `4`  is not).

Each ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:

```
.--------------------------------------------------------.
| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |
|                                                        |
| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |
| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |
'--------------------------------------------------------'

```

Here,  `?`  represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as  `101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403`; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are  _much_  more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!

Start by determining which tickets are  _completely invalid_; these are tickets that contain values which  _aren't valid for any field_. Ignore  _your ticket_  for now.

For example, suppose you have the following notes:

```
class: 1-3 or 5-7
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50

your ticket:
7,1,14

nearby tickets:
7,3,47
40,4,50
55,2,20
38,6,12

```

It doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid  _nearby tickets_  by considering only whether tickets contain  _values that are not valid for any field_. In this example, the values on the first  _nearby ticket_  are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three  _nearby tickets_: the values  `4`,  `55`, and  `12`  are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your  _ticket scanning error rate_:  `4 + 55 + 12`  =  _`71`_.

Consider the validity of the  _nearby tickets_  you scanned.  _What is your ticket scanning error rate?_
